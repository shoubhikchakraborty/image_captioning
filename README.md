# Image Captioning
## **Project Details**
The objective of this project is to generate Image Caption using neural network. The code is implemented based on the paper _Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption
Generation with Visual Attention_. I have used Flickr 8k dataset form kaggle to train the model.
